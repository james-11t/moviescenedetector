# Movie Scene Detector

A Python project that uses binary image classification to detect whether a movie scene snapshot is real or AI generated. Makes use of a neural network which is trained on two classes of data: frames generated by Veo3 (Google's latest AI video generational model) alongside frames from real world movie scenes for comparison. 

# Functionality

• User inputs an image

• If the image is identified on the user's system, it will be passed to the classification model

• The classification model utilises the dataset it was trained on to detect whether the user's image was real or AI generated (assuming the user has inputted an image of a clip/movie scene)

•  If the model is not certain about the class the image belongs to (e.g. probability it belongs to the favoured class is less than 0.9), then we can assume the image the user passed does not represent a snapshot of a movie scene. Hence, we raise an error

# Future Improvements

• Scrape a wider range of video sharing platforms to develop a more accurate model

• Install a GPU for efficiency in testing

• Potentially create more classes to increase model accuracy (current model may falsely predict that a fictional movie is AI generated)

# How To Run

The model has already been trained, so all you need to do is run this command:

<pre> python moviescenedetector.py </pre>

Make sure to load the images you want to test into the repository provided, so the program is able to identify the file path.
